!!!!!! Carly and Jeni have over 20 years of combined experience as editors. For the last three years, they’ve used their storytelling knowledge to help authors glean storytelling wisdom from movies on their podcast, Story Chat Radio. Their conversational teaching style makes writing-craft concepts easy to understand, and their ~~competition~~ ~~arguments~~ friendship makes it fun.

!!!!! _Carly and Jeni have a real talent for giving listeners insights into the mechanics of what makes a story work (or not). I’ve also really benefited from their query critique at the end of the episodes, from both getting mine critiqued, but also hearing what they had to say about others’ work. Story Chat Radio is a great resource for writers of all stages, and I would highly recommend tuning in._
