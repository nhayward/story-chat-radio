        content: "!!!!! Sometimes playful, sometimes serious, always educational and inspirational! Story Chat Radio is easily in my “top 10 list of best podcasts for creative writers.” Amid witty banter, the hosts take a deep dive to deconstruct popular films like The Princess Bride, Get Out, Up, and Parasite. Each episode focuses on a story element like structure, theme, antiheroes, tension, or symbolism. As a bonus, they also include an on-air critique of an author-submitted query or blurb. I find my writing becoming stronger every time I listen to another show. This podcast couldn’t be more perfect for aspiring authors.\n!!!!! \n!!!!! **_-Richelle Renae_**\n"

        content: "!!!!! Story Chat Radio is an excellent podcast for authors wanting to better understand writing craft. Each month, editors Jeni and Carly use movies to break down different aspects of storytelling into easily understandable nuggets that authors can apply to their own writing. They have a great dynamic and make learning interesting and fun. With their depth and breadth of knowledge from their extensive experience as editors, you are sure to learn something with each listen. Bonus points if you watch the movie before you listen!\n!!!!! \n!!!!! **_- Jennifer Kinzler_**\n"
