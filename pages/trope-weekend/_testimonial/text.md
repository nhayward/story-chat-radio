!!!!! 
!!!!! Story Chat Radio is an excellent podcast for authors wanting to better understand writing craft. Each month, editors Jeni and Carly use movies to break down different aspects of storytelling into easily understandable nuggets that authors can apply to their own writing. They have a great dynamic and make learning interesting and fun. With their depth and breadth of knowledge from their extensive experience as editors, you are sure to learn something with each listen. Bonus points if you watch the movie before you listen!

![Idiot proof advice with a laugh on top. I could start and end my review by saying, I have listened to every episode of this podcast at least twice and am a 10x better author for it. But I'll go on. Jeni and Carly are 100% relatable, funny and very informative. If there is an episode you don't think applies to you, listen to it anyway, something will be valid for your writing, I promise. The tips are well rounded and palatable. I'm learning so much about writing and story craft each time. I WISH they would do bi-weekly! Maybe we can get that Phil segment or all those Reenactments mentioned on the show? Lol. Thanks for offering great content!](Testimonial_1.png){.center-img}
