### What’s included

**Three days of trope talk!**
* Four hours of live classes
* The chance to workshop the use of tropes in your WIP
* Hands-on exercises, practical tools, and recommended additional resources 
* Q&A with our two fabulous editors

**And of course, movie & cocktail night!**
* Watch a movie live with the editors and other participants. Then join in a discussion of the movie's storytelling elements—the good, the bad, and the overdone—and get to know the other writers. 

You can attend this online 3-day workshop live, download the video recordings* afterward, or both. Written transcripts can also be provided upon request. 
 
###### _\*Recordings and transcripts are only available for Saturday’s curriculum. See full schedule below._

Jeni Chappelle and Carly Hayward do an amazing job delivering writing tips and tricks in an understandable way. I had no idea I could relate to writing concepts as seen in movies as much as I do.](Testimonial_2.png)
