### What’s included

**Three days of trope talk!**

* Hands-on exercises, practical tools, and recommended additional resources 
* Q&A with our two fabulous editors

**And of course, movie & cocktail night!**

I could start and end my review by saying, I have listened to every episode of this podcast at least twice and am a 10x better author for it. But I'll go on. Jeni and Carly are 100% relatable, funny and very informative. If there is an episode you don't think applies to you, listen to it anyway, something will be valid for your writing, I promise. The tips are well rounded and palatable. I'm learning so much about writing and story craft each time. I WISH they would do bi-weekly! Maybe we can get that Phil segment or all those Reenactments mentioned on the show? Lol. Thanks for offering great content!](Testimonial_1.png)
