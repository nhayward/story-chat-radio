I could start and end my review by saying, I have listened to every episode of this podcast at least twice and am a 10x better author for it. But I'll go on. Jeni and Carly are 100% relatable, funny and very informative. If there is an episode you don't think applies to you, listen to it anyway, something will be valid for your writing, I promise. The tips are well rounded and palatable. I'm learning so much about writing and story craft each time. I WISH they would do bi-weekly! Maybe we can get that Phil segment or all those Reenactments mentioned on the show? Lol. Thanks for offering great content!](Testimonial_1.png)
