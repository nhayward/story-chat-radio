        content: "What’s so helpful about Story Chat Radio is the use of commonly watched movies or shows and relating their structure to storytelling, which we as authors do. Besides the pleasant banter, there are some real, easy-to-see gems that relate to your writing in plot, characterization, story arc, and development. Well worth the listen.\r\n\r\n**_- Bruce Conord, author of the upcoming thriller, COME AND GET HER_**\r\n\r\nThe on-air critique I received of my query letter from Story Chat Radio helped me ditch the unnecessary and really tie down the specifics. The editors offered constructive and encouraging feedback, and I came away with a clear vision of how to best improve my work. I’m proud of the query letter I ended up with, and I’m grateful to Story Chat Radio for helping me get it there.\r\n\r\n**_- Genalea Barker_**\r\n"
