        content: "!!!!! Story Chat Radio is the editor-hosted show that I've been looking for. Writing advice can often be too daunting to retain, but Carly and Jeni's approach makes learning about writing techniques very easy. Movies offer a place of reference where the techniques are clear to see. Then, Jeni and Carly's humor and high level of expertise make their explanations easy to follow. The topics they cover are broad but they pick apart each facet of the subject, offering a ton of wisdom and actionable steps to master the technique. It's a perfect mix of fun and knowledgeable advice.\n!!!!! \n!!!!! **_- Tiffany Lewis_**\n!!!!! \n!!!!! Story Chat Radio is an excellent podcast for authors wanting to better understand writing craft. Each month, editors Jeni and Carly use movies to break down different aspects of storytelling into easily understandable nuggets that authors can apply to their own writing. They have a great dynamic and make learning interesting and fun. With their depth and breadth of knowledge from their extensive experience as editors, you are sure to learn something with each listen. Bonus points if you watch the movie before you listen!\n!!!!! \n!!!!! **_- Jennifer Kinzler_**\n"
