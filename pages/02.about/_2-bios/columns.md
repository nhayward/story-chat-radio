        content: "![Carly Hayward](Carly_Hayward.png)\n\nCARLY HAYWARD is a developmental novel editor who helps authors find their voice and bring their book to light. With 10+ years in publishing, she’s worked all over the industry, including at a big 5 publishing house, a small press, and a literary agency. She is a co-founding Revise & Resub (#RevPit) editor as well as an EFA and CWiP member. Editing combines her love of reading, giving advice, and logic puzzles. When not reading or working she lounges with her husband being vastly amused by their cats or binge-watching TV.\n\n[BookLightEditorial.com](https://booklighteditorial.com?target=_blank) <br>\n[Carly's Twitter](https://twitter.com/FromCarly?target=_blank)"
