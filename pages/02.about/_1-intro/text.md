# Welcome to Story Chat Radio!

We are book editors Carly Hayward and Jeni Chappelle, and we put ourselves through the arduous tasks of picking movies. And then watching the movies. And then thinking and talking about the movies. Not to mention the popcorn.

All for you and your story. We know—we sacrifice so much…

Every month we watch a different movie with an eye for storytelling and novel writing. Then we use our training and years of experience editing novels to break down different storytelling elements to help you improve your novel-in-progress.

At the end of each show we critique a blurb/query submitted by one lucky writer. The only requirement: your piece must be related to/comp that month’s movie. (Interested in submitting? Follow along on Twitter where we will announce the movie and make a call for submissions)
