        content: "!!!!! Sometimes playful, sometimes serious, always educational and inspirational! Story Chat Radio is easily in my “top 10 list of best podcasts for creative writers.” Amid witty banter, the hosts take a deep dive to deconstruct popular films like _The Princess Bride_, _Get Out_, _Up_, and _Parasite_. Each episode focuses on a story element like structure, theme, antiheroes, tension, or symbolism. As a bonus, they also include an on-air critique of an author-submitted query or blurb. I find my writing becoming stronger every time I listen to another show. This podcast couldn’t be more perfect for aspiring authors.\n!!!!! \n!!!!! _-Richelle Renae_"
