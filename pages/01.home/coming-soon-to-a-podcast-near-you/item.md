We are book editors Carly Hayward and Jeni Chappelle, and we are so excited to introduce our new podcast, Story Chat Radio. Each month we’ll watch a different movie with an eye for storytelling and novel writing. Then we’ll use our training and years of experience editing novels to break down each movie’s storytelling elements to help you improve your novel-in-progress. In each episode, we’ll also feature a query or book blurb for a manuscript that has elements similar to our movie of the month. New episodes will air the last Tuesday of every month starting October 29, 2019.

Want a taste of what to expect? Listen here:

October’s show is about the Jim Henson classic, The Dark Crystal. If you use The Dark Crystal as a comp or your manuscript has elements similar to this film, check our pinned post on Twitter to learn how to get your query or blurb featured on our very first episode!

Each episode of our podcast will be posted right here on our website. You can follow us on Twitter and Instagram @StoryChatRadio.
